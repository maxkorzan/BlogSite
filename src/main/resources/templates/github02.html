                <p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/team03.jpg" alt="">
                <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                <p>Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>

                <p>Open source software is based on the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software. For more information, see the “About the Open Source Initiative" on the Open Source Initiative.</p>

                <p>When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information, see “Choose an open source license" at choosealicense.</p>

                <p>For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                <p>You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same octocat/Spoon-Knife repository you just forked.</p>

                <p>Fork a repository to start contributing to a project. You can fork any public repository to your user account or any organization in which you have repository creation permissions. For more information, see "Permission levels for an organization."</p>

                <p>You can fork any private repository you can access to your user account or any organization on GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise in which you have repository creation permissions. For more information, see "GitHub's products."</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
