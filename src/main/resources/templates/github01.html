                <p>GitHub is a global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for US$7.5 billion.[3] It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[4]</p>

                <p>GitHub offers plans free of charge, and professional and enterprise accounts.[5] Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects.[6] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts.[7] As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users[8] and more than 100 million repositories[9] (including at least 28 million public repositories),[10] making it the largest host of source code in the world.[11]</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>

                <p>GitHub was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco</p>

                <p>On February 24, 2009, GitHub team members announced, in a talk at Yahoo! headquarters, that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month alone. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged.</p>

                <p>On July 5, 2009, GitHub announced that the site was being harnessed by over 100,000 users. On July 27, 2009, in another talk delivered at Yahoo!, Preston-Werner announced that GitHub had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[13]</p>

                <p>GitHub's mascot is an anthropomorphized "octocat" with five octopus-like arms</p>
                <p>The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock,[49] a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images.</p>
                <p>GitHub became interested in Oxley's work after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo.[50] The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.[49] Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.[49]</p>
                <p>GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,[49] and trademarked the character along with the new name.[47] Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on The Octodex.[51][52]</p>
